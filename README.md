# Random--Access--File--in--JAVA

PROBLEM :
A random access file contains integers. Write a program that reads the file and 
replaces all the integers that are square free semi prime( factors of the number are prime ) to 0 
and also counts the number of such replacements.

Semi prime
4 – factors ( 2 ) but not square free 2 * 2 = 4( should not be included)
6 – factors( 2,3 ) square free( included)
9 – factor (3) not square free ( 3 * 3 ) = 9(should not be included)
15 – factors( 5, 3) square free(included)
